Abstract

One of the goals of the music information retrieval (MIR) community is to research new methods and create new systems that can efficiently and effectively retrieve and recommend songs from large databases of music content. Despite the volume of research in the area, there is a lack of music databases to support these works, i.e. databases that comply with some quite desirable requirements for the development of researches, such as: a huge amount of music pieces, the audio signal availability and a great diversity of audio attributes. In order to contribute to the MIR community, we present Music4All, a new music database which contains metadata, tags, genre information, 30-seconds audio clips, lyrics, and so on. Additionally, we also exemplify some MIR tasks that may benefit from our database and compare it with other databases proposed in the literature.
